### Hi, ðŸ‘‹ I'm Adam

---

I'm a full-stack, JavaScript developer aspiring towards mastery in computer science.

Formerly, an electronic / mechanical technologist, I love working with all kinds of technology!

Currently I am bulding projects in my spare time with Svelete & Rust, but work with Angular professionally.

Check out my projects, and, if you're feeling generous, I'm open to feedback on anything I have built!
