ðŸš€ Full-Stack JavaScript Developer | Tech Enthusiast | Building with GO & Python | Angular Pro

Formerly an electronic/mechanical technologist, I've transitioned into the world of full-stack development. With a passion for all things tech, I'm on a quest for mastery in computer science.

Currently, I'm crafting exciting projects in my free time, exploring the power and capability of Go & Python, while professionally wielding the Angular toolkit. Dive into my projects, and if you're up for it, I welcome your valuable feedback on my creations!

Let's get building! ðŸŒŸ
