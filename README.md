### Hi, ðŸ‘‹ I'm Adam

I'm a full-stack, angular developer aspiring towards mastery in computer science.

Formerly, an electronic / mechanical technician in the railway field. I'm always looking for ways to apply the troubleshooting, analytical and critical thinking skills I have learned through years of fixing problems in high-pressure environments.

Currently I am bulding projects in my spare time with Svelete & Rust as my main stack.

Check out my projects, and, if you're feeling generous, I'm open to feedback on anything I have built!
