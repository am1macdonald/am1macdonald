### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Adam

I'm a front-end web developer aspiring towards proficiency at full-stack development.

Currently working as an electronic / mechanical technician in the railway field. I'm always looking for ways to apply the troubleshooting, analytical and critical thinking skills I have earned along the way.

Check out my projects and, if you're feeling generous, I'm open to feedback on anything I have built!
